### Development Tips

Before committing, run `npm test`, which will run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (enforcing the [Semistandard style](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)) on all our sample code to ensure the samples are consistently formatted.

File changes will be watched and also linted with ESLint if you have run `npm start` prior to editing the samples.

If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), you can create a new file at `.vscode/settings.json` with the following contents to enable live linting on the HBS files:

```json
{
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "handlebars"
  ]
}
```
